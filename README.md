# Pathfinder
Python visualization of Pathfinding and Traversal algorithms
Uses pygame library for front end and can perform BFS, DFS and Dijkstras Algorithm
Each grid square has a "weight" and the absolute difference of two adjacent squares' weights is considered the "edge weight"
that will be used in Dijkstras algorithm.
